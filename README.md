This is a curated list of research software projects providing code meta data, which facilitates replicability, reproducibility and reusability (RRR) via an ini-file as suggested in:

J. Heiland, J. Fehr, C. Himpe and J. Saak. Best Practices for Replicability, Reproducibility and Reusability of Computer-Based Experiments Exemplified by Model Reduction Software. arXiv Preprint, http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01191 , 2016.

An additional benefit is the visibility and discoverability of scientific source codes.
